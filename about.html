					<p>Hey there! I'm <span class="ab-name">Samantha</span>, but everyone calls me <span class="ab-name">Sam</span>.<br>I'm based in Virginia, USA.</p>
					<p>I've been working with 3D art, animation, and modeling since my teenager years, thanks to my love for video games and animated shows. I started with animation and lighting/rendering, and eventually reached into the other aspects of 3D. I've kept at it long enough to be able to turn it into a career, now reaching <script>var currentYear = new Date(); document.write(currentYear.getFullYear() - 2017);</script> years worth of experience!</p>
					<p>Even though this portfolio has an obvious focus on certain subjects (since most of these are from personal projects & motivation for now), I'm still excited to explore many more subjects, topics, and styles to expand my skillset, and I've found it is very easy to do.</p>
					<p>Feel free to reach out if you'd love to have me as a part of your project!</p>
